### Shapes drawing app, made using desing patterns and MVC architecture.

This application is done in Java Swing.
User can: 
  Draw multiple shapes,
  Undo and redo,
  Change colors,
  Select and edit existing shapes,
  Move shapes above/under each other,
  Export his drawing into a file and import existing files.
  
I learned how to:
  use Java Swing to design a desktop application;
  properly implement command, adapter, prototype and strategy design patterns;
  use existing Java serialization and observer pattern;
  properly divide software into MVC and tie them together;
  create and use dialogs.
